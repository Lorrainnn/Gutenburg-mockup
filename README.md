Hihi

**Some thoughts:**<br>
Some I would expect to improve:
book description: Helpful and worth to include: add parse logic to rdf file would works as parsing <pgterms:marc520> in each rdf. (implemented in mockup)

Favoites feature. Enable user to have a personalized favourate booklist.

(implemented in demo)
**What I implement:**<br>
Most front-end UI: 
language shift/language filter/pagination button/sort button
links:
Main titile jump back to home page.
bookcard jump to specific book page.
Resizeble

**Todo list:**<br>
 Bookshelves
 Some has comments for future update. <br>Backend logic.. <br>
